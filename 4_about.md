## About me

I am currently a student at the ETH Zürich majoring in Electrical Engineering.

When I first got an iPad I was disappointed that there was no decent way to
write and edit programs on it. So I decided to write my own code editor.

## FAQ

### Why did you choose that name?

The icon started out as a stylized capital C which gradually evolved into what
you can see now. I kept referring to the app as “Nautilus” and the name stuck.

### How can you move a document or folder to a different project?

Tap and hold its thumbnail.

### How do you select in edit mode?

Again, tap the thumbnail.

### Why can't I select or move a folder?

First close the folder before doing anything with it.
