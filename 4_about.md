## About me

I am currently a student at the ETH Zürich majoring in Electrical Engineering.

When I first got an iPad I was disappointed that there was no decent way to
write and edit programs on it. So I decided to write my own code editor.

## FAQ

### Why did you choose that name?

The icon started out as a stylized capital C which gradually evolved into what
you can see now. I kept referring to the app as “Nautilus” and the name stuck.

### What kind of git hosting services does it support?

GitHub, GitLab CE, GitLab.com and Bitbucket have all been tested with the app.
But it should be able to clone any repository provided via https.

### How can you move a document or folder to a different project?

Tap and hold its thumbnail.

### How do you select in edit mode?

Again, tap the thumbnail.

### Why can't I select or move a folder?

First close the folder before doing anything with it.
